/// \brief      Main module for Problem 1: Titanic.
/// \author     Georgii Zhulikov
/// \author     Sergey Shershakov
/// \version    0.1.0
/// \date       01.02.2021
///             This code is for educational purposes of the course "Introduction
///             to programming" provided by the Faculty of Computer Science
///             at the Higher School of Economics.
///
/// 1) Define an alias VecStrings for the std::vector<std::string> datatype
/// using the typedef keyword.
///
/// 2) Create a function called toCountSurvived that obtains an input stream
/// object (given by reference) istream& (input.csv), reads the whole file
/// line by line and saves surnames ("Braund; Mr. Owen Harris" will be just
/// "Braund") of survived people from input.csv (Survived column).
/// The function returns data of type VecStrings -- vector of surnames of survivors.
///
/// Use intermediate functions in task 2 to do the following:
/// 2.1) Extract data (surname and whether the person survived or not) from one line of input.
/// 2.2) Extract surname from a string containing full name.
/// 
///
/// 3) Create a function printVec.
/// The function prints the content of the given vector out to the standard output.
/// It should takes a vector as argument by reference and print the value of the 
/// elements as well as their enumeration.
/// 1) Name_1
/// 2) Name_2
/// ...
/// N) Name_n
///
///
///
/// 4) Create a function called getFareForClass that takes an input stream object
/// istream& and an integer number representing class (Pclass, 1 to 3), reads the stream 
/// until the end and returns the mean fare value of people of the given class.
/// The function returns a single value of type double -- the mean fair value.
/// Use at least two intermediate functions in problem 4.
///
///
/// Additional problems
///
/// 5) Create a function called genThreeDigitNumber(const int& randomState).
/// The function returns a random three digit number as std::string.
/// Use:
/// std::mt19937 gen(randomState);
/// std::uniform_int_distribution<int> distr(0,9);
/// int rNum = distr(gen); // random number
///
/// 6) Create a new vector newVec as VecStrings and fill it with random numbers.
/// newVec size should be the same as the size of the vector obtained from toCountSurvived
///
///
///   Workshop 8
///
/// 6) Reverse the vector containing names of surviving passengers using std::reverse.
/// Sort this vector using std::sort
/// Include library <algorithm> to access these functions.
///
/// 7) Implement a function printVecIter that takes two vector iterators as arguments
/// and prints the elements of the underlying vector. The iterators should represent
/// the start and the end of the vector.
///
/// 8) Use a regular iterator and a reverse iterator (.rbegin()) to print the vector 
/// containing survivor names in a straightforward order and in a reverse order
/// with the function printVecIter.
/// 
/// 9) Using the sorted list of surnames find the first and last surname that starts with
/// the letter "H".
/// Create a new vector and use functions std::find and std::copy to copy all surnames
/// starting with "H" into it.
